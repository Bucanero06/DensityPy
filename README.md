Part of a larger codebase, currently still undergoing a code review and refactoring along the manuscript and 
thesis writing process. This is a placeholder for now, I will be updating this README as I go along.
so have left this README as a placeholder for now.

Thank you guys and let me know if any sections have been helpful, of course questions are welcomed, I am the only maintainer of this piece of code at the moment and there are areas yet to clean up plus more expansions that have been planned so a spare set of eyes and ears can and do go a long way.

I am currently having difficulties with my knight's email, please reach out to me here, Github, otherwise either ruben.fernandez.carbon@gmail.org or ruben@carbonyl.org to DM me.
