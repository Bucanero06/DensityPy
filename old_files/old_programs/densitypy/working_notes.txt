!talk about setting up molcas refer to manual instead of explaining it


#Manual Example using CO_2:
-Since CHarge Migration uses informations aquired from Open Molcas, it is usefule to .....



!Setting up pymolcas input file
Here we will go over a basic set up of the input file for co2 pymolcas hoever for more complicated cases where more input may be needed or to aquire in depth explinations on the vast capabilities of OpenMolcas , their manual can be found at https://molcas.gitlab.io/OpenMolcas/sphinx/index.html or https://molcas.gitlab.io/OpenMolcas/Manual.pdf for the pdf form.

!IDEA IS BLANK BLANK talking about luscus and etc what modules are required, these are the main.. blah

#Gateway
Lets begin by creating co2.input and adding the &GATEWAY section which contains information like where to find the coordinate file, the basis of choice for the simulation, and group symmetry. This program combines the geometry of the molecule and the definition of the bais,thus is required given than all subsequent calculations will make use of this data.
	&GATEWAY
	 Title= CO2
	 coord = co2.xyz; basis = 6-311++g_st__st_.0.molcas; group = c1

#SEWARD and SCF
seward produces the one and two electron integrals while scf(self-consistent field) computes the Hartree-Fock wave funcition where Molcas performs a closed-shell and open-shell calculation. It is important to note that the Charge Migration uses information computed by the RASSCF module and not SCF, however it is useful, as it will be done next, to first run SCF and then running the external GUI program LUSCUS to visualize/select the active orbitals. 

#Selecting active space 
Restricted Active Space self-consistent field (RASSCF.)

So far we have quickly covered the GATEWAY, SEWARDS, and SCF sections of the input file and should have something similar to what is found below.

	&GATEWAY
		 Title= CO2
		 coord = co2.xyz; basis = 6-311++g_st__st_.0.molcas; group = c1
	&SEWARD
	&SCF
	&GRID_IT
	ALL

You may have noticed the addition of the &GRID_IT section, when the input is ran this will generate the file co2.lus (run with $pymolcas co2.input). After running open the file with LUSCUS, select the active space and save the file (co2.GvOrb).

!!!!Show Pictures and comment explaining how to select active space. here you can also explain orbitals and what electrons and shit and stuff fill in please dont forget 

After this step
